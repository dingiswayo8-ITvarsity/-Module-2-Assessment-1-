                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, 
          such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons.
           Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
           Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>

     <p>As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al outlined evolutionary features,
            including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes. [36]
            Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight,
            to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).
            Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders). </p>
           <p>Giraffes are fairly social animals and get together in herds from time to time. However, there is no group bonding. Youngsters stay with a few adult females and the males are nomadic and move between groups of females.
          Because Giraffes do not have a fixed breeding season, males are always wandering in search of receptive females. The male's fight for dominance, 
          and for the right to mate with females, is fascinating to watch. They use their long muscular necks to strike at an opponent's body and wrestle by twining their necks around each other. The loser is pushed off balance and
          the encounters very rarely lead to serious injury. Giraffes are generally quiet animals that go about their business with an air of serenity. Occasionally, when disturbed, they will snort and, when attacked by predators, they bellow.
